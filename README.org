* About 
  - Dirmark is the simplest directory manager ever. It consists of a single file where you place the directories that you would like to easily switch between. 
  - It is a telescope plugin that allows you to switch between directories with a single command.
  - Has the ability to add the current directory in the list of directories.
  - Or edit the list of directories in the file directly.
  - There are no dependencies, it is a single lua file that you can place in your `lua` directory.
* Status
    This are the very early stages of the plugin, so expect bugs and missing features.
    I dont yet have a proper readme as you can see bellow.

* Install 
    - You can install it with your favorite plugin manager, for example with lazy:
    #+BEGIN_SRC lua
    use {
        '42dotmk/dirmark',
        config = function()
            require('dirmark').setup()
        end
    }
    #+END_SRC
